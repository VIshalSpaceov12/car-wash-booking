# Remaining TypeScript Build Fixes

## Current Status
- Gallery and Image Management system implementation: ✅ COMPLETED
- Database schema updates: ✅ COMPLETED  
- Most TypeScript errors: ✅ FIXED

## Remaining Tasks to Complete Build

### 1. Fix BookingModal Props Interface (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File**: `/app/shops/[id]/page.tsx` - Line 364
**Issue**: BookingModal component expects `shop` prop but receiving `service` prop
**Status**: ⏸️ IN PROGRESS (last interrupted task)

**Fix needed**:
```typescript
// Current (broken):
<BookingModal service={{...}} />

// Should be:
<BookingModal shop={{...}} />
```

### 2. Remaining TypeScript Compilation Errors
Based on build process, these files likely still need fixes:

#### A. Parameter Type Issues
- Various functions with implicit `any` parameters
- Event handlers missing proper React event types

#### B. State Type Issues  
- Some `useState` hooks still using implicit `any[]` types
- Object properties accessing on potentially null/undefined values

### 3. Expected Build Resolution Timeline
- **1-2 more files** with similar TypeScript issues
- **5-10 minutes** to resolve remaining parameter type errors
- **Final build success** expected after fixing BookingModal props

## Next Steps When Resuming
1. Continue from BookingModal props fix in `/app/shops/[id]/page.tsx`
2. Run `npm run build` to identify next TypeScript error
3. Apply fixes systematically (similar to previous pattern)
4. Complete build process
5. Test Gallery and Image Management system functionality

## Completed Gallery Features ✅
- Gallery tab in shop owner dashboard
- BookingGallery component for image management  
- Add Images functionality for completed bookings
- Database schema with beforeImages/afterImages fields
- API endpoints for booking image upload/retrieval
- Image upload with drag-drop interface
- Camera button for quick image addition

## Testing Priority After Build Success
- Gallery image upload and display
- Before/After image management
- Search and filter functionality in gallery
- Add Images modal workflow
- Database persistence of booking images
